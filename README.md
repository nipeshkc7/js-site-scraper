# js-site-scraper

This is a simple site-scraper built using **puppeteer-core** and **chrome-aws-lambda**.

## Run with docker

The recommended way of running this is with docker-compose as this manages the environment variables and doesn't require you to install chromium based libraries separately. 
Run:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Run locally

Run using node.

```
npm start
```
